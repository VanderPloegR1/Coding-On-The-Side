# I will use comments to explain code directly in the file!
# We're going to look at some math characters: + - / * % < > <= >=
# Each of these does something different

# + does addition
print(5 + 6) # This will print the solution of the problem

# - does subtraction
print(1 - 1) # This will simply print the number like above

# / does division
print('2.0 / 3.0 =', 2.0 / 3) #only one nubmer needs the .0
# the '.0' is to make python use floating point (look it up!)
# using the , we can have multiple things in a single print function

# * is for multiplication
print('5 * 3 =',
        5 * 3)
# since there is a comma, we can have this print function on multiple lines

# % is the modulo operation
# this returns the remainder of a division problem
# 10/3 = 3 with a remainder of 1
print("The remainder of 10 / 3 is:", 10 % 3) # the answer will be 1

# < is the less than sign
# if we put in a comparison that is true, it will say true
# if we put in a comparison that is false, it will print false
print(3 < 4) # this will print True
print(4 < 3) # this will print False

# > is the greater than sign
print(3 > 4)
print(4 > 3) # How do you think this will return?

# <= >= these signs denote less/greater than OR equal to
print(2 >= 2)
print(2 > 2)
#2 is equal to itself, not greater than itself, so the first statement is true
# the second is false

# notice that some print commands use "" and others use ''
# both are valid
# also, there is a space between the numbers and operators, this is best pactice
# 4 + 4 is more readable than 4+4
